 ### Slot Machine Game in JavaScript

This is a simple slot machine game built using JavaScript. The game allows users to input a deposit amount and then simulates the spinning of three reels. The reels contain various symbols, and if the user matches three of the same symbol, they win a prize.

#### Prerequisites

To run this game, you will need:

* Node.js installed on your machine.
* A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

#### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Run the game by running `node project.js`.

#### How to Play

To play the game, simply enter a deposit amount and press enter. The game will then simulate the spinning of three reels. If you match three of the same symbol, you will win a prize. 

#### Code Overview

The game is implemented using a simple JavaScript function called `playGame`. This function takes a deposit amount as an argument and then simulates the spinning of three reels. The reels are represented by three arrays, each containing the possible symbols.

The `playGame` function first generates a random number between 0 and 2 for each reel. This number is then used to select a symbol from the corresponding array. The three symbols are then displayed to the user.

If the user matches three of the same symbol, the `playGame` function calculates the prize amount and displays it to the user. Otherwise, the user loses their deposit.

#### Conclusion

This is a simple slot machine game that can be easily customized to add more symbols, reels, and prizes. It is a great way to learn about JavaScript and how to simulate random events.

#### Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets from the `playGame` function:

```javascript
// Generate a random number between 0 and 2 for each reel
const reel1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
const reel2 = Math.floor(Math.random()
